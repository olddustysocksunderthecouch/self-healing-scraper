# Self-Healing Scraper

> **Self-Healing Scraper** is an opinionated TypeScript framework that **detects selector drift and automatically patches itself** using an LLM (OpenAI Codex CLI). Ship your scrapers once ‚Äì they will look after themselves from then on.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Self-repairing selectors** ‚Äì when the HTML layout of the target site changes, the built-in validator flags consecutive extraction failures, kicks off the healing orchestrator and lets Codex submit a pull-request style patch.

‚Ä¢ **Plug-and-play storage** ‚Äì start with simple JSON-on-disk; swap in Postgres, DynamoDB, S3 or anything that implements the `StorageAdapter` interface.

‚Ä¢ **Fully typed, battle-tested utilities** ‚Äì a common `BaseScraper` class, robust retry helpers and Jest fixtures take the pain out of writing site-specific modules.

‚Ä¢ **First-class DX** ‚Äì strict TypeScript, ESLint + Prettier, Vitest/Jest, Husky hooks and GitHub Actions are pre-wired so you can focus on business logic, not boilerplate.

‚Ä¢ **Container-ready** ‚Äì one-command launch with Docker Compose or Kubernetes CronJobs.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local)

Requirements: **Node 20 LTS** (managed automatically if you use [Volta](https://volta.sh)) and **pnpm** ‚â• 8.6.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Run the example scraper (example.com product page)
pnpm scrape https://example.com/product/123

# ‚Üí JSON result is printed and persisted under ~/.selfheal/data/exampleSite.json
```

If a selector mismatch is detected, the CLI exits with code `2` and logs:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Drift detected for exampleSite. Healing orchestrator should be triggered.
```

Hook this exit code into your CI/CD (or the provided GitHub Action) to automatically fork the healing pipeline.

### Docker (Optional)

```bash
docker compose up --build selfheal
# or
docker run -it self-healing-scraper:latest scrape https://example.com/product/123
```

```

Key contracts live under `src/types/` and remain stable across releases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Run type-check & build to ./build
pnpm build

# Auto-recompile on save
pnpm build:watch

# Lint & format
pnpm lint           # ESLint (airbnb-base + prettier)
pnpm prettier       # Fix formatting issues

# Tests
pnpm test           # Jest with Puppeteer runner
pnpm test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

Pre-commit hooks run `pnpm lint` automatically. Push hooks execute the full test suite so that broken code never hits `main`.
