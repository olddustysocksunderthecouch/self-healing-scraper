# Self-Healing Scraper

[![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-%3E90%25-brightgreen)](./coverage/lcov-report/index.html)

> **Self-Healing Scraper** is an opinionated TypeScript framework that **detects selector drift and automatically patches itself** using an LLM (Claude Code CLI). Ship your scrapers once ‚Äì they will look after themselves from then on.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Self-repairing selectors** ‚Äì when the HTML layout of the target site changes, the built-in validator flags consecutive extraction failures, kicks off the healing orchestrator and lets Claude Code submit a pull-request style patch.

‚Ä¢ **Plug-and-play storage** ‚Äì start with simple JSON-on-disk; swap in Postgres, DynamoDB, S3 or anything that implements the `StorageAdapter` interface.

‚Ä¢ **Fully typed, battle-tested utilities** ‚Äì a common `BaseScraper` class, robust retry helpers and Jest fixtures take the pain out of writing site-specific modules.

‚Ä¢ **First-class DX** ‚Äì strict TypeScript, ESLint + Prettier, Vitest/Jest, Husky hooks and GitHub Actions are pre-wired so you can focus on business logic, not boilerplate.

‚Ä¢ **Container-ready** ‚Äì one-command launch with Docker Compose or Kubernetes CronJobs.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local)

Requirements: **Node 20 LTS** (managed automatically if you use [Volta](https://volta.sh)) and **pnpm** ‚â• 8.6.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Run the example scraper (Property24 rental listing)
pnpm scrape https://www.property24.com/to-rent/walmer-estate/cape-town/western-cape/10163

# ‚Üí JSON result is printed and persisted under ~/.selfheal/data/exampleSite.json
```

If a selector mismatch is detected, the CLI exits with code `2` and logs:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Drift detected for exampleSite. Healing orchestrator should be triggered.
```

Hook this exit code into your CI/CD (or the provided GitHub Action) to automatically fork the healing pipeline.

### Docker (Optional)

```bash
docker compose up --build selfheal
# or
docker run -it self-healing-scraper:latest scrape https://www.property24.com/to-rent/walmer-estate/cape-town/western-cape/10163
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Run type-check & build to ./build
pnpm build

# Auto-recompile on save
pnpm build:watch

# Lint & format
pnpm lint           # ESLint (airbnb-base + prettier)
pnpm prettier       # Fix formatting issues

# Tests
pnpm test           # Jest with Puppeteer runner
pnpm test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

Pre-commit hooks run `pnpm lint` automatically. Push hooks execute the full test suite so that broken code never hits `main`.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration

The self-healing capability is powered by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI tool for Claude. When selector drift is detected:

1. The healing orchestrator invokes Claude Code with specific flags:
   - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` enables fully autonomous operation
   - `--output-format json` provides structured responses for programmatic processing

2. Claude analyzes the HTML fixture and updates the selectors in the scraper code

3. The system verifies the fixes by running tests

4. On success, changes are automatically committed with an `auto-heal:` prefix

### Configuration

To use Claude Code for self-healing:

1. Install Claude Code CLI: [Installation Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage)

2. Set your API key:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with specific instructions for Claude
